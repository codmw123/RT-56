costa_rica.1.d코0=Despite the presence of a movement wishing to re-elect President Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno, he rejected any attempt at a second term, believing that this would be anti-democratic. The National Republican Party therefore chose León Cortés Castro as its candidate for the presidential election.\nThe opposition had difficulty forming, with on the one hand the National Party facing numerous refusals to stand for election, particularly from former President Julio Acosta, diplomat Octavio Beeche Argüello was finally chosen as the main opposition candidate, while on the other hand the Communist-inspired Workers and Farmers Party made its first entry into an election, but without much success.\nLeón Cortés Castro was elected with just over sixty percent of the votes, in line with his party's hegemony over Costa Rica's politics.
